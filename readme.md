Hi this is supposed to be the repository for my website.  
Uses `react` and `webpack`

install `webpack` by `npm i -g webpack` and if you want to use the dev server, also install `npm i -g webpack-dev-server`


To build it, run `npm run build`  
or if on windows, `npm run win-build`


To launch live server to `http://localhost:8080/` run `npm run start`  
or if on windows, `npm run win-start`
