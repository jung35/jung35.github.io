Hi this is supposed to be the repository for my website.  
Uses `react` and `webpack`


To build it, make sure to install `webpack` globally by doing `npm i -g webpack`  
Then run `npm run build`


To launch live server to `http://localhost:8080/` make sure to run the webpack dev server globally by `npm i -g webpack-dev-server`  
Then run `npm run start`
